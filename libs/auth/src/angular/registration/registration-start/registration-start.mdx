# RegistrationStart Component

The Auth-owned RegistrationStartComponent is to be used for the first step in the new email
verification stagegated registration process. It collects the user's email address (required) and
optionally their name. On cloud environments, it requires acceptance of the terms of service and the
privacy policy; the checkbox is hidden on self hosted environments.

### Cloud Example

### Self Hosted Example

### Query Param Example

The component accepts two query parameters: `email` and `emailReadonly`. If an email is provided, it
will be pre-filled in the email input field. If `emailReadonly` is set to `true`, the email input
field will be set to readonly. `emailReadonly` is primarily for the organization invite flow.
